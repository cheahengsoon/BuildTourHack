# Task 0 - Machine Setup Instructions

Before you get started let's make sure your machine has everything installed to be able to complete all tasks for the workshops. Please take some time to go through these steps to save time later during the day.

1. Install [The Hack Checklist](http://aka.ms/hackcheck/) from the Windows Store.  Run the tool to make sure you have all components installed.

2. If you are missing components **ask one of the proctors for their USB key** to install the missing components. We have Visual Studio 2017 Community edition, Unity tools, Docker and more on the USB key. 

    ## Don't try to download from the internet, the network connection is really slow and you are wasting some time downloading instead of having fun

    ## If you are missing Azure tools, do **NOT** try to use Web Platform Installer. Launch Visual Studio Installer and add the Azure Capability ![Adding Azure Capability](./images/add-azure.png)

3. Go to [our backlog](http://aka.ms/bthack) and have some fun
